# Untitled Endless Runner Video Game
This is the code for my Spring 2020 Lewis University Video Game Programming 2 course. 
It is an endless runner with a medieval theme and has the player run to collect coins and jump over enemies and obstacles.

How to run:
First, you must have downloaded VS Express 2013 for Desktop.
Since we never created an icon to run the application, the application must be run through debugging.

To run the game, you must first download all files onto your machine.
After you have finished downloading, you must open Source/EndlessTilesSource/PC/SimpleMenusPCVS2013.sln in VS Express 2013 for Desktop.
Then after loading the above file, run the file, and the application will run.
You will come across a intro GUI where only the Play button and Exit will work. 
Press Play and begin your endless running. 

To exit the application:
1. You can collide with an obstacle/enemy which will result in a game over. From there, you can start a new run or go back to the main menu.
2. While in the main mode of gameplay, you can hit the ESC key to exit immediatley.

NOTE: None of the ingame mechanics work such as the power ups or the pause button. Only the GUI was created for design purposes.
