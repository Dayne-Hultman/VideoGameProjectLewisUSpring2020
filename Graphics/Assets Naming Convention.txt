This is a guide to naming and navigating the Assets
When creating New Assets, use this guide to remain consistant 


Basic Naming Scheme:

NameOfTheFileFolderForTheAsset_DescriptionOfTheAsset__VersionOfTheAsset*_VersionNumberOfTheAsset_SizeOfTheAsset_FormatOftheAsset**_AmountOfFramesInTheAssets***_Misc****
*      Use only if the Asset has two or more versions of the same name
**     Use only if the Asset is in two or more formats
***    Use only if the Asset has a Sprite Sheet
****   Use only if the Asset has any other Information 


Example:
Player_Knight_Ducking_Placeholder_Big_Gif_4FrameSheet.gif

~The Asset Exsists in the 'Player' folder, so begin with 'Player'
~The Asset is of a knight, so Knight is a fitting Description
~The Asset is of the knight ducking, as opposed to the walking version, so Ducking is added
~The version Number for this Asset is 'Placeholder', as it is the placeholder for the true asset.
    -When Assets that may make it into the final game are added, placeholder is replaced with a number corresponding with 
        How many have been made before it. 
    -For the release Asset, this tag should be 'Final'
~The Asset is of a 1024 pxl by 1024 pxl size, know as 'Big'. This can be changed with the dimensions of the Asset as needed
~The Asset tagged as 'Gif', as there is a Png sprite Sheet of this same version
~The Asset is tagged as 4FrameSheet, as it is derived from 4 frames
~The Asset has no Misc tag, as the Misc Tag is not needed on this Asset
